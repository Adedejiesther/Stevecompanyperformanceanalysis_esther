OBSERVATION

The best product is coffee and also the sales rep for the year is Nancy.
The best region of the year is North and also the best sales month is December


RECOMMENDATION

I strongly recommend that Nancy as the best sales rep of the year should be moved and promoted to another branch or another city to help them with the sales
I also recommend that the least product sold should be on promo and advertised more
Lastly the least sales rep should be sent for more learning to be able to have more knowledge on how to promote the company sales
